## Real tech tasks solutions
All cases in this repository are real interview tech tasks for a senior data analyst position, mostly in marketing or growth teams.
I rename companies to protect their anonymity. 
I chose only successful tech tasks. Thus, you can see an acceptable work level for successful data analyst tech interview completion. 
Basically, there are 3 types of tech interviews for data analysts:
* Online test. Usually, test SQL skills. 
* Home task. The company provides a dataset and tech task description and gives 1 week for its solution.
* Tech interview. Candidates are asked to write some scripts in SQL / Python during the interview. 
However, some companies use various combinations of these types.
