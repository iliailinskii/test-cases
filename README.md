# Data analyst tech tasks
During my career, I have faced many different tech tasks for data analysis. In this repository, you can find my solutions and a couple of recommendations for analysts.

## Real tech tasks solutions
All cases in this repository are real interview tech tasks for a senior data analyst position, mostly in marketing or growth teams.
I rename companies to protect their anonymity. 
I chose only successful tech tasks. Thus, you can see an acceptable work level for successful data analyst tech interview completion. 
Basically, there are 3 types of tech interviews for data analysts:
* Online test. Usually, test SQL skills. 
* Home task. The company provides a dataset and tech task description and gives 1 week for its solution.
* Tech interview. Candidates are asked to write some scripts in SQL / Python during the interview. 

However, some companies use various combinations of these types. 
### Company A
This company is specialized in call-center automatization with their AI bots. Their tech task tests analyst ability to find insights in data, prepare visualization and provide recommendations to the business.

## Best practice
Here I collected main points of how to complete analyst tech task and some small tips for it.

### Choose instrument 
Nowadays, there are lots of instruments that allow you to demonstrate your analyst skills. 
I suppose [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install) to be one of the most widespread ones. There is a number of pros to using it:
- Use python for working with data
- Ability to organize research structure
- Convenient markdowns system, so you can follow your scripts with comments and conclusions
- Standard format 

So you can write scripts and presentations for research all in one. 
By the way, I conduct all my studies in [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb). I chose it because I had only the old-fashioned laptop with 2 cores processor and sometimes worked in the library public computers. Thus, Colab let me not be limited with laptop resources and be flexible in working on the project from different devices. Among other pros Colab is much easier to set up. In fact, you need just open the link and also you can share it by link. 
> Small tip. You can use Colab Pro version with GPU and additional RAM for 10 euros per month. And still, all these things are highly affordable, because you can have lots of calculation resources even on the super cheap devices (in extremal case even on tablet or smartphone)

### Instrument to demonstrate SQL skills
Firstly, I highly recommend trying these [site](https://sqliteonline.com/)
